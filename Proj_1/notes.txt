4 suits to a deck 
    13 ranks per suit 
        making a total of 52 cards 

- initial thoughts
    create one loop to go through the suites 
        and another to go through the ranks 
            but first we need variables 
- tell computer all of the suites and ranks that exist 

- could write every card within another array out by hand
    but lets just use a for loop

- nest the rank loop
